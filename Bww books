Britt World Wide Reading List
I do not have the complete Britt World Wide Reading List. I’m sure they have added new books in recent years. The titles below are books that were recommended during my time in Amway. I have read all of these books and absolutely loved them.

# 1: How to Win Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie

Network marketing is the ultimate people business. You must be likeable and know how to get along with others if you want to build a big team. Basically, you need to master your people skills. This is the greatest book ever written on how to get along with other people. It helped me immensely and I know it can have the same impact with you.

# 2: The Magic of Thinking Big by Dr. David Schwartz

Most people sell themselves short and underestimate themselves. Most people think small and struggle with confidence and worthiness issues. If that describes you, this book will help you. This book teaches people how to become confident, think big, and overcome their fears. It is one of my top three favorite books of all time.

# 3: Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki

This is one of the best-selling business books of all time. Robert Kiyosaki teaches the difference between how entrepreneurs and employees think. He teaches people the importance of assets, creating passive income, and why you should own your own business. This book is one of my all-time favorites.

# 4: Bringing Out the Best in People by Alan Loy McGinnis

This book teaches you how to bring out the best in others. Since Amway is a team sport, the information in this book will help you learn how to motivate, inspire, recognize, and help other people grow and succeed. This is an all-time classic.

# 5: The Go-Getter by Peter Kyrne

The Go-Getter will teach you how to become a go-getter. It’s an older book, but still relevant. You can read the book in about an hour. It tells the story of how one man went from nothing to something through sheer determination.

# 6: Think and Grow Rich by Napoleon Hill

The is quite perhaps my # 1 self-help book of all time. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve read this book. If you want to learn how wealthy people and successful people think, this is the book for you. Just about every other self-help book written is based off the principles you will learn in this book.

# 7: Acres of Diamonds by Russell Conwell

This is another life-changing book. It will help you discover that you can be successful right where you are at right now. There are plenty of opportunities right under your feet, if you will only recognize them.

# 8: How I Raised Myself from Failure to Success in Selling by Frank Bettger

If you want to learn how to sell, this book is the only book you need to read and study. Mr. Bettger was one of the most successful salesmen of all time, and in this book, he shares some of his best selling secrets with you. My copy of the book has hundreds of underlined passages.

# 9: The Greatest Salesman in the World by Og Mandino

This book has the “scrolls” in it. Study this book and these scrolls for a few months and you can program yourself to be VERY successful in selling. Og Mandino is my favorite author of all time.

# 10: The Five Love Languages by Gary Chapman

The Five Love Languages helped me in my marriage, in my friendships, and in the business. Learn the different ways that people perceive love and find out how to make others feel loved and appreciated.

There are many other books on the Britt World Wide reading list, but these ones are my favorites.
