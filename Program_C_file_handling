Create a File
To create a file, you can use the w mode inside the fopen() function.
The w mode is used to write to a file. However, if the file does not exist, it will create one for you:
Example
FILE *fptr;

// Create a file
fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "w");

// Close the file
fclose(fptr);

Write To a File
Let's use the w mode from the previous chapter again, and write something to the file we just created.
The w mode means that the file is opened for writing. To insert content to it, you can use the fprint() function and add the pointer variable (fptr in our example) and some text:
Example
FILE *fptr;

// Open a file in writing mode
fptr = fopen("filename.txt", "w");

// Write some text to the file
fprintf(fptr, "Some text");

// Close the file
fclose(fptr);
